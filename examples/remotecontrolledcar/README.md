## Qt Realm Controlled Car

Open the project in the [Qt Creator](https://www.qt.io/download) app and run both targets to proceed. The Controller leverages MongoDB Realm to control the Carâ€“ so both apps can be run independently of each other. In separate processes or on different machines around the world.
